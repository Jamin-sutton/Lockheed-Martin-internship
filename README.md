# Lockheed-Martin-internship
Here are a few of my coding projects:

DNA converter: Uses DNA datasets from kaggle
               Converts these DNA values (A, C, G, T) into binary and then into images
               This is one of my favorite projects since I didn't know what the image would look like
               I may do further research into using the images produced by this program to identify certain proteins based on the pixels
               
Image filter: I coded the helpers.c file which has multiple functions for manipulating images
              The rest of this project is from Edx's CS50 course
              This is my favorite C project and I found it quite intriguing how a low level language like C works compared to Python
              
Sirpinski algorithm: This program performs the Sirpinski algorithm on a polygon of a specified number of sides
                     This project also uses Pygame in order to visually display the algorithm
                     Note: patterns can be seen as the number of sides increases but the Sirpinski pattern is best seen on 3 sides (triangle)
                     I originally decided to work on this project because I wanted to see what would happen if this algorithm was performed larger polygons
                     
Hangman: This is just a console based version of the typical game hangman
         I used the technique of creating a game class which encompasses the majority of this program
       
Random number generator: This program uses a seed time to generate a random number based on pi
                         This program will display the occurance of the numbers generated (0-9) and compare them to the Random library
                         I really enjoyed making this project since it allowed me to dig deeper into how a logical program could produce 'random' numbers
                         
TicTacToe: This program is a console based version of tic tac toe
           The computer moves are random so the computer is very easy to beat
           In the future I would like to an engine to the computer in order to increase the difficulty
           
Wordle: I hopped on the hype train for this one and made a console version of the popular wordle game
        This was a difficult project due to the string manipulation required
        
RPS one line: This a console version of rock paper scissor but I coded it all in one line
              This project was fairly difficult since I challenged myself to code it all in only one line
              The code is hard to read and I had to use some interesting techniques, but I really enjoyed this challenge
